# Camera-survelliance-car
The objective of the project was to make a camera surveillance car, whose movement on a floor can be controlled by the user, and to provide a complete 360 degree coverage by attaching the camera with a pan tilt servo base, where the pan tilt servo base rotates 180 in the vertical as well as the horizontal direction.
